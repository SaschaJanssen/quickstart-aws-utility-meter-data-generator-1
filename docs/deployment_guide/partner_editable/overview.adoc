This guide covers the information you need to deploy the {partner-product-name} Partner Solution in the AWS Cloud. It is for users who want a serverless solution to generate simulated device data and add them to an Amazon Timestream database at a regular interval. It uses an AWS CloudFormation template and allows for users to create a new Amazon Timestream database table as a starting point for other solutions. The solution can also use an existing Amazon Timestream database table.

{partner-product-short-name} simulates virtual smart meters readings by generating a meter ID, connected load, and voltage level using random values between predefined ranges. For the generated virtual smart meters, interval reads are created for a number of blocks based on a predefined value. The solution generates interval reads using a load duration factor (a certain load running for certain duration which translates to energy consumed). It applies the load duration factor on the connected load for the smart meter. Each interval read includes kW, kWh, kVA, kVAh, power factor, voltage, current, and the interval read timestamp.

While the simulated data is for smart meter readings, it can be modified for other industry use cases.
