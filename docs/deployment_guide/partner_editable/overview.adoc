This Quick Start is for users who want a serverless solution to generate simulated device data and insert thousands, or even millions, of records into an Amazon Timestream database at a regular interval. It uses a CloudFormation template and allows for users to create a new Amazon Timestream database/table as a starting point for other solutions, or it can use an existing Amazon Timestream database/table.

{partner-product-short-name} simulates virtual smart meters readings at by generating a meter Id, connected load, and voltage level using random values between predefined ranges. For the generated virtual smart meters, interval reads are created for x number of blocks based on predefined value. The interval reads are generated using load duration factor (assuming certain load running for certain duration which translates to energy consumed). The load duration factor is applied on the connected load for the smart meter. Each interval read includes kW, kWh, kVA, kVAh, power factor, voltage, current and the interval read timestamp. 

While the data simulated is for smart meter readings, it can be modified for other industry use cases.

This guide covers the information you need to deploy the {partner-product-name} Partner Solution in the AWS Cloud.
